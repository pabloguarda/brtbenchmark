This repository includes R code to reproduce the analyses of the following journal publication:

Guarda, P., Velásquez, J.., Tun, T.H., Chen, X. and Zhong, G., 2017. Comparing Chinese and non-Chinese Bus Rapid Transit: Evidence from evaluation of global BRT based on BRT design indicators. Transportation Research Record 2647, 118–126.
